# Tap Tape
The app helps the user to measure an object in their photo by choosing a reference object with a known length. It asks the user to tap a start point and an end point of the reference object and the object they want to measure inside the selected photo. Then according to the ratio of the two lines, the app can calculate the length of the measuring object.
